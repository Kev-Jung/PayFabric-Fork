PayFabric APIs - Version 3.1
==============
PayFabric APIs are organized around Representational State Transfer (**REST**) architecture and are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Below are the API endpoints:

1. Live Server:    ``https://www.payfabric.com/payment/3.1/api``
1. Sandbox Server: ``https://sandbox.payfabric.com/payment/3.1/api``

We have a [detailed guide](Sections/Authentication.md) for authenticating your users with our APIs.

API Documentation
-----------------
PayFabric sends and receives payloads as structured [JSON Objects](Sections/Objects.md). 
Many of these objects are used in both requests and responses. Some of the objects (like Address or Cardholder) are embedded
as child elements of other objects.
