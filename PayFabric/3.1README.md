PayFabric APIs - Version 3.1
==============
PayFabric APIs are organized around Representational State Transfer (**REST**) architecture and are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Below are the API endpoints:

1. Live Server:    ``https://www.payfabric.com/payment/3.1/api``
1. Sandbox Server: ``https://sandbox.payfabric.com/payment/3.1/api``
