Incremental Authorization

<b>Incremental Authorization</b> represent additions to previously authorized amounts and do not replace the original authorization. The sum of all linked estimated and incremental authorizations represents the total amount authorized for a given transaction.

Set *Action* = *IncrementAuthorization*, then *AdjustAmount* means increasing *AdjustAmount* on the specified approved transaction, the final amount will be updated with equation: New Final Amount = Original Final Amount + Adjustment Amount; Incremental authorization is available for Approved Sale and Authorization transactions. But Incremental authorization request will be failed if the transaction had adjustment tip or the Authorization transaciton has been captured/partially captured.
